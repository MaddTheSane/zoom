Installing glk-geas on OS X

Introduction

glk-geas is a version of geas that uses Glk as its user interface.


Instructions for installing on OS X

First you need to build a Glk library.  This document does not discuss
that.

Then you need to make sure you know what values to select for GLKDIR and
GLKLIB:

GLKDIR - the directory where the Glk library and its header file are
  found.  The Makefile assumes that these two things are in the same
  place.
GLKLIB - the necessary libraries to link against in the form of "-l"
  options passed to the linker.  These will be the Glk library itself
  and any additional libraries that it requires.

Building on OS X is carried out from within Terminal using make.

You'll need gcc installed (you probably knew that if you read this far).
It's in Developer Tools which should be an optional install on the
original CDs or DVDs that came with your Mac.  Some versions of Developer
Tools are available as a (huge) download from Apple.

The make file for glk-geas is "Makefile-glk".  The make target for
glk-geas is "glk-geas".  The values for GLKDIR and GLKLIB can either
be changed by editing the file "Makefile" or can be specified on
the command line:

make -f Makefile-glk 'GLKDIR=../../../glkterm-078' 'GLKLIB=-lglkterm -lncurses' glk-geas

This should produce the program called "glk-geas".  This can be run from
terminal supplying it with the name of a Quest game file (currently
stderr needs redirecting to avoid corrupting the display):

$ ./glk-geas 2>&- Beam_1_10.cas

Please get in touch (<drj@pobox.com>) if you have any problems.

You may be interested to know that I cross-compiled a PowerPC binary,
building it on my Intel Mac:

make -f Makefile-glk 'GLKDIR=../../../glkterm-078-ppc' 'GLKLIB=-lglkterm -lncurses' 'CC=gcc -arch ppc' 'CXX=g++ -arch ppc' glk-geas

That required that I had already built a PowerPC Glk library first,
natch.
