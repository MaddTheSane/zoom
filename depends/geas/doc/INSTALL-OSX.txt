Installing geas on OS X

Introduction

geas is an Open Source interpreter for the Quest format of computer
text adventures.  geas was created by Mark Tilford.
geas can be used to play the files produced by Quest, such
as Beam_1_10.cas (an entry into the 2006 IFComp).

Geas was originally designed to run on Linux.  To install and run it on
OS X you currently have two options (neither very Mac-like):

1) Build the GTK version of geas.  This uses the X11/GTK toolkit to
display its user interface.  You will need to be running an X11 server
to run it.  Instructions are in INSTALL-OSX-GTK.txt .  There are no
binaries provided for this as it uses an infeasible number of third
party libraries that would need to be included and some of the libraries
cannot easily be moved.

2) Build the Glk version of geas.  This uses the Glk interface to
display its user interface.  Glk is a portable toolkit later, a program
that uses Glk can be displayed using any of the user interfaces that Glk
supports.  The Glkterm interface has been used on OS X.  You need to use
Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities) to run this.  Instructions are in
INSTALL-OSX-GLK.txt.
