Installing gtk-geas on OS X
David Jones <drj@pobox.com>


Introduction

gtk-geas is an Open Source interpreter for the Quest format of computer
text adventures.  gtk-geas was created by Mark Tilford.
gtk-geas can be used to play the files produced by Quest, such
as Beam_1_10.cas (an entry into the 2006 IFComp).

This document is a series of instructions for building a runnable
version of gtk-geas that runs on Mac OS X (gtk-geas was initially
designed to run on Linux).  The author of this document used these
instructions to run gtk-geas on Mac OS X 10.4.8 on Intel hardware.  It's
entirely likely that other versions of Mac OS X and PowerPC hardware will
work, but they're untested.  I would be pleased to receive reports of
success.

I have only a surface understanding of most of the technologies used in
building gtk-geas so it's entirely possible that there are simpler ways
or that this method does not work for you for some reason.  Please feel
to get in touch (drj@pobox.com), but please don't be disappointed if I
can't help.  If you have any comments or suggestions to improve this
document then also get in touch.

See INSTALL-OSX.txt and INSTALL-OSX-GLK for alternative installations on
OS X.


Overview and Prerequisites

gtk-geas relies on a number of major technologies none of which come by
default on Mac OS X, but all of which can be installed (either using
Apple's installers provided with the OS installation media, or third
party installers).  Let me warn you now, none of this is very Mac like;
it's all very Unix like.  You'll need X11 server (Apple), X11 SDK
(Apple), gcc (Apple), GTK (fink).

The Apple installers come on the OS X installation discs, so you
must have these discs.  These are the CDs or DVDs that came with
your computer or the ones from the new OS if you upgraded from 10.3
to 10.4 (or similar).

You'll also need to use Apple's Terminal application (it's in
/Applications/Utilities if you don't know where to find it).  Many steps
in the procedure described below require you to type commands into a
Terminal window.  If you're not familiar with Terminal then don't panic,
but please be careful when typing.

You will also need to execute these instructions from
an account with administrator privileges (which if you're the only
person using your Mac you almost certainly have).


Procedure

If you have a set of 10.4.6 install DVDs (like I do) then insert Disc 1.

Installing gcc:

[Skip this step if you know you already have gcc installed]

Open the "Xcode Tools" folder.  Open the XcodeTools.mpkg document (it's
a package installer).  This runs the Installer program.  Click your way
through this until it's installed everything that it wanted to.  To
check that it has worked, open a Terminal window and type "gcc" followed
by Return.  You should get a response something like:
"i686-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.1: no input files".


Installing X11

[Skip this step if you know you already have X11 installed]

Open the "Optional Installs" package.  This is at the top level of the
10.4.6 Install Disc 1 but you may need to scroll the Finer window to
find it.  Click your way through this and when presented with a list of
packages to install select the X11 package and continue until it's
installed.  To check that X11 is installed open your Applications
folder, there should be an X11 application now.


Installing fink

(fink is a repository of Unix software for OS X)

[Skip this step if you know you already have fink installed]

Download a fink binary installer from
http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/bindist.php
Open the installer, click it until it installs.
I downloaded Fink-0.8.1-Intel-Installer.dmg .  You may need the PowerPC
version, and there may be newer version by the time you read this.
If you need more detailed hand-holding or are unsure on some aspect,
please refer to the fink documentation on
http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/users-guide/index.php (specifically
section 2).
If you have Terminal windows open at this point then you should probably
close them and reopen them (to get the new environment variables that
allow you to run fink).


Enabling fink's unstable tree

[Skip this step if you know you already have the unstable tree for fink
installed]

(This is a summary of the instructions contained in FAQ question 5.8 for
fink; please refer there for more detailed instructions:
http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-fink.php?phpLang=en#unstable )

The file /sw/etc/fink.conf needs editing; the line beginning Trees:
needs the text " unstable/main unstable/crypto" adding to it.
If you're Unix skills are good you can simply go to a Terminal window
and type "sudo vi /sw/etc/fink.conf" and perform the edit.

If you're a Unix novice, then do this:
- First find the /sw/etc folder in Finder: use the Finder's "Go >>
  Computer" menu item, then open the system disk.  In that disk you should
  see a folder called "sw"; open it and then open the "etc" folder
  contained within.
- Copy the fink.conf file to the desktop (which I do by
  dragging and using F11 to exposÃ© my desktop).  Ctrl-click on the
  fink.conf copy that you made and select "Open With >> TextEdit".
- Find the line beginning "Trees:" and add the text " unstable/main
  unstable/crypto" to the end of the line.  Save the file and close TextEdit.
- Drag the fink.conf file from the Desktop back to the /sw/etc folder;
  Finder will say that you need to authenticate and that you may be
  overwriting a file.  Overwrite the file and authenticate (I have a
  sneaking suspicion that things are not so simple in OS X 10.3).

Having edited the fink.conf file you need to run some fink commands in
order to make it take notice:
Open a Terminal window (or use one already open) and type the commands:
"run fink selfupdate; fink index; fink scanpackages" followed by Return.


Installing gtkmm-2.4

Go to a Terminal window and type "sudo fink install gtkmm2.4-dev"
followed by Return.  Authenticate by using your password.
This will take some while.


Building gtk-geas

All of this takes place in a Terminal window, so open one (or find one).

cd to where the geas folder has been unpacked.  For me this is
geas-osx-src-0.1 on my Desktop, and I use the following sequence of cd
commands:
  cd
  cd Desktop
  cd geas-osx-src-0.1
type make to build geas:
  make
If successful this should have built a program in a file called
gtk-geas.  Check by doing:
  ls -l gtk-geas


Running gtk-geas

gtk-geas requires X11 and must be run from within an X11 window.  Start
X11 (it's an application in Applications/Utilities).  You should see a
window a bit like Terminal appear (like Terminal only faster and more
ugly) titled "xterm".  From within this xterm window you need to cd to
where you built gtk-geas and then run it:
  cd
  cd Desktop
  cd geas-osx-src-0.1
  ./gtk-geas &
This should start gtk-geas.  gtk-geas may (and definitely will on early
beta versions) print text and messages on the xterm window whence it was
launched, you should ignore these.  Especially since I suspect they
contain spoilers for any game you try and run.

Enjoy.
